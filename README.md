# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning models for classification, text mining, text analysis, data analysis and data visualization.
# Dataset Information
We use and compare various different methods for sentiment analysis on tweets (a binary classification problem). The training dataset is expected to be a csv file of type id,label,tweet where the id is a unique integer identifying the tweet, label is either 1 (positive) or 0 (negative), and tweet is the tweet enclosed in "". Similarly, the test dataset is a csv file of type id,tweet. Please note that csv headers are not expected and should be removed from the training and test datasets.
